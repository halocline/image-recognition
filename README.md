# Image Recognition using node-yolo wrapper for Darknet + YOLO

Project demonstrates how objects can be recognized in an image and/or video file. Current configuration of the application is set to work with jpeg/png due to compute resources available (video file performance is much more tolerable when using GPU or AI specific chips).
