# Image/object recognition Web interface using Darknet + YOLO 

Project demonstrates how objects can be recognized in an image and/or video file. Current configuration of the application is set to work with jpeg/png due to compute resources available (video file performance is much more tolerable when using GPU or AI specific chips).

## Background

Exploring capabilities & feasibility for image recognition in Web and native app contexts. 

## To Dos

1. Refactor project structuring of React components. Separate components, containers, and client api calls.
2. Explore applying Google/Amazon cloud vision API services in place of local model.
3. Allow for videos in app.
